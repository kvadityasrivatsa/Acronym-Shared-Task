HLT,24,Introduction Development of large-scale grammars for natural languages is an active area of research in HLT.
HLT,25,"1st Internal Conference on  HLT research, 1-5, San Di- ego, CA."
HLT,26,Promising directions for future  application of HLT to  language tutors include incorporating continuous  speech recognition in a range of target languages  and continuing the development of dialog and  NLP-dnven animated graphics.
HLT,27,"Consequently, phenomena in- herent to natural languages may severely hamper the performance of HLT when applied to small collections."
HLT,28,This paper describes a system that attempts to cope with semantic variability through the use of state of the art HLT.

GI,42,"An em- pirical evaluation was conducted on 3596 words ex- tracted from GI (Stone et al, 1966)."
GI,43,"The labeled dataset used as a gold standard is GI lexicon (Stone et al, 1966) as in the work by Turney and Littman (2003)."
GI,44,"Largely missing from popular lexical resources such as WordNet and the GI (Stone et al, 1966) is stylistic information; there are, for instance, no resources which provide com- prehensive information about the formality level of words, which relates to the appropriateness of a word in a given context."
GI,45,Operative GI  and Radiology reports contain similar proportions  of historical conditions (9% and 6%).
GI,46,"Echocardio- grams appear to be most similar to Radiology re- ports and Operative GI reports, which  may be supported by the fact that these reports are  used to document findings from tests conducted  during the current visit."
GI,47,"Examples of report sections include Review of Sys- tems (Emergency Department), Findings (Opera- tive GI and Radiology) and  Discharge Diagnosis (Emergency Department and  Discharge Summary)."
GI,48,One is that some outcomes do not have any cue word: (5) GI symptoms and headaches have been reported with both montelukast and zafirlukast.
GI,49,"4 Methods  4.1 Dataset Generation  We randomly selected seven reports from each of  six genres of clinical reports dictated at the Univer- sity of Pittsburgh Medical Center during 2007  These included Discharge Summaries, Surgical  Pathology, Radiology, Echocardiograms, Opera- tive GI, and Emergency Department  reports."
GI,50,Operative GI and  Radiology reports showed the lowest prevalence of  both temporal expressions and trigger terms.

SVD,58,"In or- der to reduce the noise and the data sparsity, we apply the SVD algo- rithm by reducing the original vector space into 300 dimensions."
SVD,59,"In general, the algo- rithms that incorporate both statistical feature se- lection and SVD lead to the best results, except for the Hungary data when no stoplist is used."
SVD,60,"The system is based on a com- bination of k-Nearest Neighbor classifiers, with each classifier learning from a distinct set of features: local features (syntactic, col- locations features), topical features (bag-of- words, domain information) and latent fea- tures learned from a reduced space using SVD."

AR,519,Since the research described  herein we have thought of other influences on  AR and their statistical corre-  lates.
AR,520,"We incorpo-  rate multiple AR factors into  a statistical framework - -  specifically the dis-  tance between the pronoun and the proposed  antecedent, gender/number/animaticity of the  proposed antecedent, governing head informa-  tion and noun phrase repetition."
AR,521,"Although this success rate  overstates the effect, it is a clear indication that  knowledge of a referent's gender and animatic-  ity is essential to AR."
AR,522,"The more accurately the topic of a seg-  ment can be identified, the higher the success  rate we expect an AR system  can achieve."
AR,523,This indicates  that syntax does play a very important role in  AR.

SH: If there is no dependency between n and t,  and the triple does not satisfy the conditions for  Reduce, then push n onto the stack S.

SH,527,"from entity to related task: entity is a se- mantic argument of the task SH to an unrelated focus From the analysis of our WoZ data we get cer- tain intuitions about salient focus flow between some preceding dialogue and a FU Q. First of all, we learn that a dialogue context of just one previ- ous user question and one previous system answer generally provides enough information to resolve context-dependent FU Qs."
SH,528,"For this reason, the perfor- mance of ALICE might be over-estimated in this evaluation; ALICE delivered much better results than SH?s method on this corpus."

BF,553,"As English is a language with fewer inflections when compared to Romanian, which accommodates for gender and case as a suffix to the BF of a word, the automatic translation into English is closer to a human translation (experiment three)."
