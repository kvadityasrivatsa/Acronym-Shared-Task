MF,Mean Field,880,"2.1 MF Approximation Methods The simplest example of a variation method is the mean field method, originally introduced in statis- tical mechanics and later applied to unsupervised neural networks in (Hinton et al, 1995)."
MF,Mean Field,881,"3 Spin Model and MF Approximation We give a brief introduction to the spin model and the mean field approximation, which are well- studied subjects both in the statistical mechanics and the machine learning communities (Geman and Geman, 1984; Inoue and Carlucci, 2001; Mackay, 2003)."

MF,Mean Field,883,"3.3 A MF Approximation This section proposes a more accurate way to ap- proximate ISBNs with mean field methods, which we will call the mean field approximation."

LVM,latent variable model,885,"Marginalization of hidden structure is also funda- mental to other work, and featured most prominently in generative Bayesian LVMs (Teh et al2006)."
LVM,latent variable model,886,A LVM for geographic lexical variation.
LVM,latent variable model,887,Posterior regularization for structured LVMs.
LVM,latent variable model,888,"In recent years, great research has shown the strength of LVMs for natural lan- guage processing (Blunsom et al, 2008)."
LVM,latent variable model,889,A discrimi- native LVM for statistical machine trans- lation.
LVM,latent variable model,890,A LVM for geo- graphic lexical variation.
LVM,latent variable method,891,"Finally, our focus on these methods is justified by their clear advantages over other classes of models: unlike token-based or LVMs, they are much simpler and require no parameter tuning."
LVM,latent variable method,892,"However, we have to note that this accuracy of the proposed method was computed using the unlabeled data classified by the LVM."
LVM,latent variable method,893,"Therefore, we computed the accuracy for 6586 instances using the LVM and obtained 80.76 %."
LVM,latent variable method,894,This comparison shows that our method is better than or at least comparable to the LVM.
