1559,ME,microelectronics,1560,This paper discusses preparation of templates and presents results for human and machine per- formance for English ME ; a companion paper [1] presents additional experimental results.
1560,ME,microelectronics,1561,"To improve quality and consistency, three steps were taken : First, a set of relatively detailed rules for extracting information from articles and structuring it as an object - oriented template was developed (with the rules for English ME a 40-page, single-spaced document) ."
1561,ME,microelectronics,1562,"Previous experience with the English and Japanese Joint Ventures corpus had made it clear that producin g templates with a high degree of quality and consistency is a difficult and time-consuming task 11l, and we attempte d 54 to make the best use of what had been learned in that effort in producing templates for English ME with quality and consistency appropriate to both the needs of the project and the resources we had available ."

1563,NB,nave bayes,1564,"4.1 Classifiers We use a NBian model as in Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen?s (1995) experiment (cf."
1564,NB,nave bayes,1565,"To test if such a simple approach would be enough, we performed a text categorization experiment, using the Rainbow implementation of a NB term frequency times inverse document frequency (TF*IDF) method (McCallum 1997) and considering each sentence as a ?"
1565,NB,nave bayes,1566,"In this paper we generalize the tri-training al- gorithm and use three different learning algo- rithms rather than bootstrap samples to create diversity: a NB algorithm (no smooth- ing), random forests (Breiman, 2001) (with 100 unpruned decision trees) and an algorithm that induces unpruned decision trees."
1566,NB,nave bayes,1567,"In their exper- iments, they consider classifiers based on deci- sion trees, BP neural networks and NB inference."
1567,NB,nave bayes,1568,"We have experimented with a maxi- mum entropy model, Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIP- PER), and decision trees; preliminary results do not show significant improvement over the NBian model."
1568,NB,nave bayes,1569,"This contrasts with typical semi-supervised learning methods for text categorization that com- bine unlabeled and labeled data within a genera- tive model, such as multinomial NB, via expectation-maximization (Nigam et al, 2000) or semi-supervised frequency estimation (Su et al, 2011)."
1569,NB,nave bayes,1570,"For the NBian classification method, indeed, it is most important that the features be as independent of each other as possible."
1570,NB,nave bayesian,1571,"We used the NLTK (Bird, 2006) implementation of the NB classifier for all our experiments."
1571,NB,nave bayesian,1572,"ME classifiers outperform their generative counterparts (e.g., NB clas- sifiers) because they can easily handle overlapping, probably dependent features which might be con- tained in rich feature sets."
1572,NB,nave bayesian,1573,"For rhetorical relations, NB models achieve 84.90% and 57.87% accuracy in classifying NARRATION and BACKGROUND / ELABORATION re- lations respectively (16% and 23% above baseline)."

1884,OP,overparsing,1885,"Thus, a block of cells  (the set of cells each covering the same input sub-  string) is interdependent with respect o OP  operations, meaning that an OP operation  trying to fill one cell in the block is adding structure  to a partial description from a different cell in the  same block."
1885,OP,overparsing,1886,The first consequence of this is that the  OP operations must be considered after the  underparsing and parsing operations for that block.
1886,OP,overparsing,1887,"The second consequence is that OP oper-  ations may need to be considered more than once,  because the result of one OP operation (if it  fills a cell) could be the source"

2341,DP,dynamic programming,2342,"A combination of these two types of methods was developed by Kikuchi et al (2003), where summarization is performed in two steps: first, sentence extraction is done through feature combination; second, compaction is done by scoring the words in each sentence and then a DP technique is applied to select the words that will remain in the sentence to be included in the summary."

3625,CT,constituent tree,3626,The output of the parser is twofold: it produces a CT as well as a linkage that shows the dependencies between words.
3626,CT,constituent tree,3627,"Along with negation focus annotation,  this corpus also contains other annotations, such  as POS tag, named entity, chunk, CT,  dependency tree, and semantic role."
3627,CT,constituent tree,3628,"In contrast, Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan &  Bresnan 1982; Kaplan 1989), which assigns  representations consisting of a surface CT  enriched with a corresponding functional structure, is  known to be beyond context-free."

3629,CT,contrast,3630,Conclusion and Future Work         We were able to compare and CT our results  directly with previous work of Bagga and Baldwin by  using the same corpus and evaluation technique.

3631,CT,contrast,3632,The sentences  extracted form a summary that represents the entity (in  CT to our 55-word snippets).
3632,CT,contrast,3633,"2 Anaphora,  by CT, is a nonsymmetrical and nontransi-  tive relation: if NP1 is anaphoric to NP2 then,  usually, NP2 is not anaphoric to NP1, for ex-  ample."
3633,CT,contrast,3634,"In CT, the project described here has explored a non-cancellation analysis for Wambaya: even after a head combines with one of its argu- ments, that argument remains on the appropriate va- lence list of the mother, so that it is visible for further combination with modifiers."
3634,CT,contrast,3635,"In CT, German verbs with pre- fixes usually differ markedly in their preferences from the base verb."
3635,CT,certain,3636,Here we are concerned with the probability that  a proposed antecedent is correct given that it  has been repeated a CT number of times.

3639,CT,certain,3640,The decomposition  makes use of Bayes' theorem and is based on  CT independence assumptions discussed be-  low.
3640,CT,certain,3641,"However, although there is indeed a CT corre- lation between morphological class and semantic class, we claim that morphology is not sufficient for a reliable classification because it is by no means a one-to-one relationship."

4963,ST,solve time,4964,"The sparse sequence alignment technique mentioned  above is especially intriguing, because the complexity introduced in dealing with sparsity resembles in certain  respects that of the time warp problem; further, the fact that the sparse alignment problem can be solved efficiently  gives rise to hope that the same techniques can be used to ST warping."

6362,HAC,hierarchical agglomerative clustering,6363,"Preliminary experiments with the HAC algorithm showed that the number of clusters used did not have a big impact on translation quality, 1 so we will only present results that use the same num- ber of clusters as in the manual partitions (10 for Arabic and 17 for Chinese)."

6387,SO,source order,6388,Likewise SO based mod- els provide distributions over source sentences and unordered target sides of MTUs.
6388,SO,source order,6389,"The first clause (monotone, reverse) in- dicates whether the target language translation order follows the SO; the second (adjacent, gap) indicates whether the source phrases are adjacent or separated by an intervening phrase on the target side."

The Answer Extraction: this component first  filters out the triples mismatching the expected  AT."

6679,AT,answer type,6680,"Another interesting finding we have is that while the latent structured model, LCLR, performs better than the other two unstructured models, the difference diminishes after more in- formation, including the enhanced lexical seman- tic knowledge and AT verification, has been incorporated."

7444,PDN,peoples daily news,7445,"Based on the 20 words, we extracted 28,000  sentences from the 60 MB PDN  with segmentation information as our train- ing/test set which is then manually sense-tagged."

7447,PDN,peoples daily news,7448,A useful result  from this work based on (about one million  words) the tagged PDN shows  that adding more features from richer levels of  linguistic information such as PoS tagging  yielded no significant improvement (less than  1%) over using only the bi-gram co-occurrences  information.

7461,STT,speechtotext,7462,"This document is organized as follows: sec- tion 2 briefly introduces the related work; section 3 presents a characterization of the STT summarization problem and how we propose to address it; section 4 explicits our use of phonetic domain information, given the previously defined context; the next section describes the case study, including the experimental set up and results; con- clusions close the document."
7462,STT,speechtotext,7463,5.4 Experimental Results Our main objective was to understand if it is pos- sible to select relevant information from back- ground information that could improve the quality of STT summaries.
7463,STT,speechtotext,7464,"The main idea is the inclusion of related, solid background information to cope with the difficulties of summarizing spoken lan- guage and the use of multi-document summariza- tion techniques in single document STT summarization."
7464,STT,speechtotext,7465,The fisher corpus: a resource for the next generations of STT.
7465,STT,speechtotext,7466,"To support this argument, we de- veloped a new approach to STT summa- rization that combines information from multiple information sources to produce a summary driven by the spoken language document to be summa- rized."
7466,STT,speechtotext,7467,"For the ma- jority of these events, physicians and nurses generate free text data either by typing the information them- selves or by using a local or remote STT engine."
7467,STT,speech recognition outputs,7468,Indeed standard Language Models (LMs) ap- plied to OOD utterances are likely to generate erro- neous STT and more gener- ally highly noisy word lattices from which it might not be relevant and probably harmful to apply SLU modules.

7469,STT,speech recognition outputs,7470,"To test this explanation, we looked at the word error rates for the STT for the different systems."
7470,STT,speech recognition outputs,7471,The alignment of STT is fairly straightforward due to the strict constraint in word order.
7471,STT,speech recognition outputs,7472,"The method (Izumi et al, 2003) aims to de- tect omission-type and replacement-type errors and transformation-based leaning is employed in (Shi and Zhou, 2005) to learn rules to detect errors for STT."
7472,STT,speech recognition outputs,7473,"If this is so then it is possible that a relatively ac-  cepting natural anguage system might work wen with worse  STT (because ven a relatively accept-  ing natural language system can reject very had inputs), but  with better speech recognizer output one might get good per-  formance with a stricter natural language system."
