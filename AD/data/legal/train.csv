NPT,Non-Proliferation Treaty,628,"Pursuant to South Africa's accession to the NPT and its safeguards agreement with IAEA, the Agency had started to verify the completeness and correctness of the inventory of South Africa's nuclear installations and material."
NPT,Non-Proliferation Treaty,629,"The most significant indication of their efforts along the line of globalization of disarmament is their commitment to a non-proliferation regime established through the 1967 Tlatelolco Treaty, the 1968 Nuclear NPT, and through various bilateral or unilateral undertakings."
NPT,Non-Proliferation Treaty,630,"President de Klerk told Parliament that the decision to make this disclosure had been prompted by continued suspicions that, despite South Africa's accession to the NPT in 1991, not all nuclear materials had been declared to IAEA and consequently not subjected to the IAEA verification in 1992 of South Africa's declared inventory of nuclear material and facilities."
NPT,Non-Proliferation Treaty,631,The strength of the nuclear non-proliferation regime depends both on the non-nuclear-weapon States' strict compliance with their commitment not to acquire nuclear weapons and on the nuclear-weapon-States' adherence to the undertaking that they themselves have assumed under Article VI of the NPT.
NPT,Non-Proliferation Treaty,632,"Moreover, this position is a clear violation of the safeguard principles in effect in the international community; accordingly, the Government of the Republic of Paraguay urges the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to reconsider its decision and to fulfil the commitments it undertook in signing the NPT."

NPT,Nonproliferation Treaty,635,These objectives are also called for in the NPT Paragraph c) underlines the desirability that all States participate in a treaty that ends the production of fissile materials for weapons and provides for their irreversible transfer to non-weapon use or disposal.
NPT,Nonproliferation Treaty,636,"The Republic of Korea has been strongly committed to efforts to strengthen the Nuclear NPT regime, to facilitate the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and to bring about the early commencement of the negotiations on the fissile material cut-off treaty."
NPT,Nonproliferation Treaty,637,"The resulting strategy will maintain strategic stability with Russia and China, strengthen regional deterrence, and reassure U.S. allies and partners, while laying the groundwork for negotiations with Russia on how we can mutually and verifiably reduce our strategic and nonstrategic nuclear stockpiles and live up to our commitments under the Nuclear NPT."
NPT,Nonproliferation Treaty,638,We reiterate our call to make the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone and reaffirm the need for Israel to adhere to the NPT and to place its nuclear facilities under the IAEA comprehensive safeguards system.
NPT,Nonproliferation Treaty,639,"Since these verification measures are the same or extensions of existing safeguards measures already applied by the IAEA in non-weapon states under the NPT, it would be extremely inefficient to establish a new verification organization for this Treaty."
